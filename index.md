# Tech fascinates me. So do words. 

I'm searching for ways to blend them together lucratively. I make my present living from writing, but my goal is to eventually make it from web development. If you're interested, [click here to see my writing and journalism portfolio](http://samanthanorth.com).

I've lived abroad for over ten years, in China, Belgium, Qatar and Turkey. The constant need to adapt to new cultures and working environments has turned me into a much better problem-solver. That helps me a lot when wrangling new stuff in tech. 

Throughout most of 2015 I've been teaching myself web dev basics, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and WordPress. 

I mainly use free learning resources, e.g. Codeacademy and Free Code Camp, along with the help of various techie friends, in particular the tireless @pkafei.

[Kurious Koder](http://kuriouskoder.com) is worth checking out for some good coding resources and tutorials on Python and data visualisation. 

Over the coming months I'll be writing about my escalating journey into tech-dom, here on this lovely speedy little Jekyll site.
